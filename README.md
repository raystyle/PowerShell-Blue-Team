# PowerShell-Blue-Team
Collection of PowerShell functinos and scripts a Blue Teamer might use

- #### Disable-WeakSSL.psm1
This function is used for changing the registry values for RC4 and AES Ciphers as well as SSL2.0, SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1, and TLS1.2. Enabling all of the switches will set the recommended SCAP disabled and enabled values for these for IIS 10.
REFERENCE [CIS Benchmarks](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/benchmarks)
```powershell
PS> Disable-WeakSSL [ -WeakCiphers ] [ -StrongAES ] [ -WeakSSLandTLS ]
```

- ### Resolve-CVE-2017-8529.ps1
This cmdlet is meant to be run to patch the CVE-2017-8529 vulnerability on Windows computers for 64 or 32 bit architectures. This does not take any parameters other them common parmaeters.
```powershell
Resolve-CVE-2017-8529 -Verbose
```

- #### DNSZoneTransferAlert.ps1
This script is meant to be run using task scheduler in response to DNS Server Event ID 6001. Whenever a DNS zone transfer occurs this event is set off in the event logs. Triggering this script to run will send an email to the IT Administrator or whomever you define informing them the DNS zone transfer occurred as well as the IP address that initiated it. Some Windows DNS servers may need zone transfers to be enabled in order to work correctly. This alert helps turn that into an advantage for us defenders.
```powershell
PS> .\DNSZoneTransferAlert.ps1
```

- #### Get-DubiousPowerShellCommand.psm1
This function is meant to be used as a scheduled task on servers. PowerShell command logging will need to be enabled for this to work. There are arguments on whether or not this should be done. I am a believer that the input should be logged. Anyway, this checks the event log for maliciously used powershell commands. This includes commands such as __vssadmin__ (watches for NTDS.dit password extraction on domain controllers), __IEX__ (watches for remotely issued commands), and __bitsadmin/Start-BitsTransfer__ and __certutil -urlcache -split -f__ (watches for donwloading to a device through the command line).
```powershell
PS> Get-DubiousPowerShellCommand -Verbose
```

- #### Get-NewlyInstalledService.ps1
This function is meant to be run by Task Scheduler on servers whenever Event IDs 7009 or 7045 are triggered. This will inform the Administrator whenever a new service is installed on a server. I have excluded Windows Defender updates. If you have any other false positives just add an -and to Where-Object or add If statement near line 58. The BTOBTO I mentioned in the email body is referring to a python exploit that can be used if admin credentials are compromised. Most other payloads I have seen have random service names in Base64 format.
```powershell
PS> Get-NewlyInstalledService -SmtpServer mail.smtp2go.com -To rosborne@osbornepro.com -From rosborne@osbornepro.com -Verbose
```

- #### NewOpenPortMonitor.ps1
This script is meant to be run by Task Scheduler. Any unique connections made with a server are documented and placed into a log file. Any IPv4 addresses that are able to be resolved are resolved and placed in a document C:/Users/Public/Documents/ConnectionDNSHistory.csv. Any server Internet connections are logged into a separate file C:/Users/Public/Documents/ConnectionHistroy.csv. You are able to configure alerts by receiving an email anytime a new port has been opened as a listener on a device. I do not use the alerts as I have not worked on perfecting that part as this is one of my first written scripts. Stil very useful.
```powershell
PS> .\NewOpenPortMonitor.ps1
```

- #### Search-ForCompromise.ps1
This cmdlet is used for discovering possibly malicious changes on a machine. It will require a reference copy of the hosts file in Windows. It also requires a list of known applications and known Current User Applications as a reference. I have it set up to update these files if they are located in a network share which is what I use.   
    It checks the following items
1. Sorts the heaviest processes. Make sure they are all legit.
2. If the hosts file has been altered the IP Addresses are displayed. The function then requires the admin to enter the IP Addresses manually. This will close any open connections and prevent any more connections to the discovered IP Addresses.
3. If an altered start page is configured it will be shown to the admin who will need to remove the setting.
4. Checks local machine and current user registry for any previously unknown applications and shows the unknown apps to the admin. The admin should verify these applications are safe.
5. Make sure no proxy settings have been configured/altered.
6. Lastly any Alternate Data Streams are looked for and identified
```powershell
PS> Search-ForCompromise -Verbose
```

- #### UnusualUserSignInAlert.ps1
This is another script I am very proud of. This script is useful in an environment where users can log into any computer but are assigned maybe 1, 2, or 3+.  What this script does is query the event log for the last 24 hours. Anywhere a successful logon happens (Event ID 4624), the IP Address is noted and compared to the assigned IP Address list located in a CSV File you create. You can then have it notify you of the sign in by email. This is a little niche to a smaller environment.
__IMPORTANT:__ For this to work you will need a CSV file containing the user and their assigned devices. That info is imported from the CSV before it can be worked with.
```powershell
PS> .\UnusualUserSignInAlert.ps1
```

- #### Compare-FileHash.ps1
This is a very simple operation that was meant to make comparing a file's hash value to the checksum through PowerShell simplified. Instead of using Get-FileHash in powershell and then comparing the value to the site you downloaded a file from, this cmdlet caluclates the hash of the file and compares that value to the checksum which is one of the parameter values. All the same hashes are available as in the Get-FileHash cmdlet. "SHA1","SHA256","SHA384","SHA512","MD5","RIPEMD160","MACTripleDES"
The default algorithm if no algorithm is defined is SHA256.
```powershell
Compare-FileHash -FilePath C:\Path\To\File.exe -Hash 'e399fa5f4aa087218701aff513cc4cfda332e1fbd0d7c895df57c24cd5510be3' -Algorithm SHA256
Compare-FileHash C:\Path\To\File.exe 'e399fa5f4aa087218701aff513cc4cfda332e1fbd0d7c895df57c24cd5510be3'
```
