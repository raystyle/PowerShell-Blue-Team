# PowerShell-Blue-Team
Collection of PowerShell functinos and scripts a Blue Teamer might use

- #### Disable-WeakSSL.psm1 
This function is used for changing the registry values for RC4 and AES Ciphers as well as SSL2.0, SSL3.0, TLS1.0, TLS1.1, and TLS1.2. Enabling all of the switches will set the recommended SCAP disabled and enabled values for these for IIS 10. 
REFERENCE [CIS Benchmarks](https://workbench.cisecurity.org/benchmarks)
```powershell
PS> Disable-WeakSSL [ -WeakCiphers ] [ -StrongAES ] [ -WeakSSLandTLS ]
```

- #### Get-DubiousPowerShellCommand.psm1 
This function is meant to be used as a scheduled task on servers. PowerShell command logging will need to be enabled for this to work. There are arguments on whether or not this should be done. I am a believer that the input should be logged. Anyway, this checks the event log for maliciously used powershell commands. This includes commands such as __vssadmin__ (watches for NTDS.dit password extraction on domain controllers), __IEX__ (watches for remotely issued commands), and __bitsadmin/Start-BitsTransfer__ and __certutil -urlcache -split -f__ (watches for donwloading to a device through the command line).
```powershell
PS> Get-DubiousPowerShellCommand -Verbose
```

- #### Get-NewlyInstalledService.ps1
This function is meant to be run by Task Scheduler on servers whenever Event IDs 7009 or 7045 are triggered. This will inform the Administrator whenever a new service is installed on a server. I have excluded Windows Defender updates. If you have any other false positives just add an -and to Where-Object or add If statement near line 58. The BTOBTO I mentioned in the email body is referring to a python exploit that can be used if admin credentials are compromised. Most other payloads I have seen have random service names in Base64 format. 
```powershell
PS> Get-NewlyInstalledService -SmtpServer mail.smtp2go.com -To rosborne@osbornepro.com -From rosborne@osbornepro.com -Verbose
```

- #### NewOpenPortMonitor.ps1 
This script is meant to be run by Task Scheduler. Any unique connections made with a server are documented and placed into a log file. Any IPv4 addresses that are able to be resolved are resolved and placed in a document C:/Users/Public/Documents/ConnectionDNSHistory.csv. Any server Internet connections are logged into a separate file C:/Users/Public/Documents/ConnectionHistroy.csv. You are able to configure alerts by receiving an email anytime a new port has been opened as a listener on a device. I do not use the alerts as I have not worked on perfecting that part as this is one of my first written scripts. Stil very useful.
```powershell
PS> .\NewOpenPortMonitor.ps1
```

- #### Search-ForCompromise.ps1 
This cmdlet is used for discovering possibly malicious changes on a machine. It will require a reference copy of the hosts file in Windows. It also requires a list of known applications and known Current User Applications as a reference. I have it set up to update these files if they are located in a network share which is what I use.   
    It checks the following items
        1. Sorts the heaviest processes. Make sure they are all legit.
        2. If the hosts file has been altered the IP Addresses are displayed. The function then requires the admin to enter the IP Addresses manually. This will close any open connections and prevent any more connections to the discovered IP Addresses.
        3. If an altered start page is configured it will be shown to the admin who will need to remove the setting.
        4. Checks local machine and current user registry for any previously unknown applications and shows the unknown apps to the admin. The admin should verify these applications are safe.
        5. Make sure no proxy settings have been configured/altered.
        6. Lastly any Alternate Data Streams are looked for and identified
```powershell
Search-ForCompromise -Verbose
```

- #### UnusualUserSignInAlert.ps1
