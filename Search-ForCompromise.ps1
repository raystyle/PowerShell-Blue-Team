.Synopsis
    Search-ForCompromise is a cmdlet created to find/identify whether or not a device has been compromised using basic discovery methods.
    This cmdlet was designed for system administrators. No switches need to be defined other than the computer to run this on if desired.

    ALWAYS EXECUTE THIS VERBOSELY FOR EASE OF USE


.DESCRIPTION
    This cmdlet is meant to be used to help determine if a computer has been compromised.
    I would suggest always executing this verbosely.
    It checks the following items
        1.) Sorts the heaviest processes. Make sure they are all legit.
        2.) If the hosts file has been altered the IP Addresses are displayed. The function then requires the admin to enter the IP Addresses manually. This will close any open connections and prevent any more connections to the discovered IP Addresses.
        3.) If an altered start page is configured it will be shown to the admin who will need to remove the setting.
        4.) Checks local machine and current user registry for any previously unknown applications and shows the unknown apps to the admin. The admin should verify these applications are safe.
        5.) Make sure no proxy settings have been configured/altered.
        6.) Lastly Alternate Data Streams are looked for and identified

.SYNTAX
    Search-ForCompromise [ -ComputerName <string[]> ]


.EXAMPLE
    ---------------------  EXAMPLE 1  ----------------------------
   Search-ForCompromise -ComputerName $ComputerName -Verbose
   
   # This example exectus Search-Compromise verbosely on a remote computer

    ---------------------  EXAMPLE 2  ----------------------------
   Search-ForCompromise -Verbose
   
   # This example executes Search-ForCompromise on the local computer verbosely

.INPUT
    Accepts a string or an array of either Hostnames, FQDN's, or IPv4 Addresses
    
.OUTPUT
    There is no object created by this cmdlet. This used for changing settings and identifying a compromise.
