# This PowerShell function is useful in an environment where users can log into any computer but are assigned maybe 1, 2, or 3+ computers they usually sign into.DESCRIPTION
# What this script does is query the event log for the last 24 hours. Anywhere a successful logon happens (Event ID 4624) for that user is counted.DESCRIPTION
# That count is then compared to he count of how many of those logins were on their assigned devices.DESCRIPTION
# The logins that occured on devices outside the norm are then emailed to the IT admin informing them of the event(s).
#
# This is a little niche to a smaller environment. I learned a lot writing this one and will do a blog on it at https://powershell.org
# IMPORTANTL For this to work you will need a CSV file containing the user and their assigned devices.
#             That info is imported from the CSV before it can be worked with.
